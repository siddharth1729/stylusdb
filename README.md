# StylusDB

StylusDB is an experimental project aimed at developing a high-performance distributed key-value based database storage engine using Rust. The project serves as an initiative to learn and understand the internals of storage engines and distributed systems.

## End Goal

Our primary focus is to create a distributed key-value storage engine from scratch. Our future milestones include implementing a recovery system by developing a log manager for our Write Ahead Log (WAL) and more.

## Progress

-   [ ] Building an Atomic KV Store (Single-threaded for now).
-   [ ] Developing a REPL Client capable of performing operations like GET, SET, and exiting.

_(Please note that the project's goals and tasks are subject to change as we make progress.)_
